##  Alright, so once you've pulled all this new stuff and have php and composer installed, cd into main workspace folder, then run:

composer install


##  if you dont have a key in APP_KEY in your .env file then run:

php artisan key:generate


##  the only thing you need to do is fill out the db info in the .env file as follows (make sure the host and port are the same within phpmyadmin):

- DB_CONNECTION=mysql
- DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
- DB_PORT=3306
- DB_DATABASE= [whatever you named your db in phpmyadmin]
- DB_USERNAME= [whatever your username is in phpmyadmin]
- DB_PASSWORD= [whatever your password is in phpmyadmin]


##  make sure you have mamp setup and have a local db running and a user account with a password setup and running then run:

php artisan migrate


##  then:

php atrisan serve


##  then you should be able to make an account on localhost


##  Notable files/locations:


routes        ::=> /routes/web.php
views         ::=> /resources/views
controllers   ::=> /app/Http/controllers
user model    ::=> /app/User.php

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications.

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of any modern web application framework, making it a breeze to get started learning the framework.
